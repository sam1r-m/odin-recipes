    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <strong><h2 style="font-family: monospace;">Steps:</h2></strong>
    <ol style="font-family: monospace;">
        <li>Heat a saucepan over a medium heat with a tablespoon of oil and add the onion and garlic. Cook without colouring for a few minutes, then add the beef mince and season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Cook the beef until browned all over then stir in the tomato purée followed by the tinned tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pan of seasoned water to the boil and add the pasta. Stir to stop the pasta from sticking and cook for 7-10 minutes</li>
        <li>To check the pasta is cooked, taste a strand - if the center is still hard give it a couple more minutes. When it is fully cooked, drain in a colander and drizzle with a little olive oil to prevent the spaghetti from sticking together</li>
        <li>Chop the basil and stir through the Bolognese sauce. Divide the spaghetti between 4 plates and spoon the Bolognese on top. Finish with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped basil</li>
    </ol>
